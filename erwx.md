# Elden Ring Wuxing

## Generative cycle

A "natural" progression from which Fire was removed.

### Earth bears Gold

- Marika's clay body hosts the Elden Ring
- The Elden Beast came from a meteor
- Smithing hammers are explicitly stone

### Gold carries Water

- Water inside the Elden Beast's realm
- The Primeval Current?
- Stars are residual life
- Godwyn merman

### Water nourishes Wood

- Crucible stuff seems to be near waterways?
- Sorcery giving rise to Thorn Sorcery
- Radagon being a brood parasite to Rennala
- Godwyn's flesh creating Deathblight thorns

### Wood feeds Fire

- Apparent cycles of burning the Erdtree
- Radagon despising his giantish red hair
- Draconic lightning as firestarter?
- Destruction of the physical Erdtree by Gransax?

### Fire creates Earth

- Mt. Gelmir is relevant?
- If stone dragons represent the start of a cycle, they'd reappear here, a la DaS1 intro.
- Godskins appearing in Farum Azula and their draconic features?
- Several types of Fire representing several types of Death

## Destructive cycle

Relevant to most armed conflicts but not quite in line.

### Earth absorbs Water

- Leyndell absorbing Raya Lucaria by marriage
- No one cares about the Zamor?
- Mainstream culture arising from ancient Astrologers?
- How does Gravity connect to anything?

### Water extinguishes Fire

- Astrologers (non-violently) supplanting the Giants

### Fire melts Gold

- The real reason fire is forbidden?
- Marika's charge to Hewg?
- Suppression of the Godskins and Destined Death?

### Gold chops Wood

- Elden Ring taking control of the Erdtree
- The physical tree part is just missing
- Theory about pruning the branches of the Crucible

### Wood breaks up Earth

- Marika's subordination to the Erdtree itself
- Marika being crippled by Radagon's thorn lance

## Major faults

- Thorns being essential to the Giants' defeat
- What is ice?
- What is the Moon and why does it have two forms?
