## Outline

- Gurranq is initially confused at who is approaching due to muddied and mixed scents.
- Has a panic attack as the Rune of Death is abruptly ripped from him. Then realization sets in, and he becomes livid. How dare Marika?
- Phase change: Gets bigger and stretches upright. More noble-looking like Serosh but still in his black armor. This is the high priest of the beastmen, unburdened by Death.
- Full power Gurranq is a threat of the same kind as Radagon. Fast and hits like a truck while generating enough particle effects to blind you. Seamless mix of beast claw, ancient dragon, Crucible, and Two Finger incants.
- Marika fights with her full strength this time, using the power of her collected Great Runes, multiple doll bodies, Black Knives, and Crucible, Erdtree, Fundamentalist, Blackflame, and Storm incants.
- Marika has theoretically infinite lives, and Gurranq ultimately begs for death. He is incapable of betraying either master, and Marika's rebellion means he will suffer. Resolution left unclear.
