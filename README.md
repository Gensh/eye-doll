# Puppet with no Hand

_Across the Lands Between, the demigods find themselves strangely nostalgic. At the same time, one of Seluvis' dolls begins to move on its own..._

An Elden Ring fanfic based on an alternate main scenario. The structure forgoes traditional glue scenes. Instead, the narrative moves forward to the next major event (boss fight) in each even-numbered chapter. Each odd-numbered chapter is a vignette about the circumstances leading to the boss becoming who and what they are.
