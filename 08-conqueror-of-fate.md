## Outline

- Radahn Festival is short Jerren since he's a bigot, and half the protagonists are witches. They dump his body offscreen.
- Blaidd has initial perspective since he's normally present anyway. Alexander gets some focus since he's relevant later. Patches is actually present and doing something suspicious.
- First phase is normal. 2v1 Blaidd and Alexander.
- Patches shoots him with a speargun and nopes out. The golden spear looks like the Tree Sentinel halberd and sinks deeper and deeper into his flesh. He begins to go berserk, then does his falling star attack as normal.
    - Phase change: Gravity-driven red sand armor. Flame from his Great Rune. Looks like a Fire Giant with a tiny fiery horse. Attacks summon stars like Astel's.
- Blaidd is about to have a bad time, but Radahn is repelled by a Waterfowl Dance. Millicent somehow already has a prosthesis, though it's a Carian doll arm instead of Malenia's hand-me-down. Radahn is enraged by the seeming reappearance of his archenemy.
- The Doll appears at last, saving Milllicent in turn. They deal "damage" by driving the spear further into Radahn. Eventually, he hacks up Rotten blood and falls.
