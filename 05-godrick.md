It was one week since Leyndell had been dyed black. Black flags hung in the still air, and black curtains covered most windows. People went about their daytime business in a hurry, eyes glued to the streets. They did not go out after dark.

It was the first time the city had truly gone into mourning. He understood the significance. This would be in the history books, forever. But Godrick had to admit, it was an incredibly shit time to be a boy with too much energy and nowhere to use it.

Still, the gnawing fear which possessed the adults meant that it was easier to get around the Capital. And so when Godwyn the Golden's body returned home, he was one of the few who lined the streets to see it. Most of the adults acted like it was cursed or something. Hadn't the Royal Shadow Maliketh slain demigods before?

Of course it was bad that it was Lord Godwyn! But was it really so different? A body was a body. Lord Godwyn would receive Erdtree Burial just like everyone else. Heck, he was being buried beneath the Erdtree itself! Not one of its roots! He'd be reborn in no time!

Unfortunately, there wasn't much to see. A bunch of gloomy knights and a hearse pulled by troll knights. Ah, but there was his uncle Godefroy. Godrick couldn't decide if he wanted to wave or salute, but then he realized neither was probably polite to do at a funerary procession.

After the hearse had passed, he hurried home and wrote a letter to his uncle. He passed it to a servant and sent them off. While he waited for the reply, he busied himself by rereading an old dramatization of the battle between Lord Godwyn and the ancient dragon Fortissax. It was one of his favorites, but it wasn't very popular. Dragons were still regarded fairy poorly by the people of the Capital. Godrick supposed he couldn't blame them. It _was_ kind of a bother to walk around the immovable corpse of Gransax.

Eventually – no doubt after the procession and delivery and reporting and going home to clean off the road dust – the reply from Uncle Godefroy came. Of course he would be willing to see his favorite nephew. All day tomorrow would be perfect. They had serious matters to discuss. Godrick couldn't wait. He took dinner early and tried to sleep, but nervous energy kept him up well into the night. Still, he rose early, prepared himself, got his favorite practice axe ready, and hurried to his uncle's manor.

"I want you to leave the Capital."

Godrick recoiled as if struck. To hear such a thing from such a paragon of knighthood…

"Humor me, my boy. If all is well, this will have been just a little field trip. But mark my words: the Queen is not well."

Godrick looked at his uncle with a puzzled expression, his brows knit in thought. For starters, that was blasphemy. He'd never heard anyone say something so negative about Queen Marika. Sure, her son had died, and everyone loved Lord Godwyn. But this was Marika the Eternal. God. Not some weepy noble.

Godefroy murmured and stroked his mustache.

"A true warrior learns to read these things, Godrick. Do you think our forebears merely strong of arm? Lord Godfrey, it was said, could read his foes' thoughts the moment they had them, just by studying their eyes. I am no Godfrey… but there was something wrong with Queen Marika. I would pray it was only grief… but to whom should I address such prayers?"

"Come on, Uncle. Surely, it's not that bad. The demigods have all been called back to the Capital. There's no place that could be safer."

The knight looked toward the Erdtree and grimaced.

"I am not permitted to say this, but I want you to understand the gravity of the situation, Godrick."

"But General Radahn isn't–"

"This is serious, boy. We can't find Lunar Princess Ranni, and the Two Fingers can't contact her shadow. Godwyn the Golden may not have been the only victim of the attack. If the demigods are coming here, they're painting a target on the Capital. That means it's the last place for an untrained young scion to be."

Godrick grumbled deep in his throat. Still, he had studied the histories faithfully: "In the beginning, everything was in opposition to the Erdtree." Lord Godfrey did not conquer the lands by charging headlong into danger.

Truth be told, the situation _was_ odd. Queen Marika had not made public appearance nor offered any words for the grieving Capital. Maybe writing the perfect elegy for her greatest son was simply taking longer than expected. But where was Radagon? Where was the Elden Lord when the people needed guidance?

Godrick sighed.

"Alright, Uncle. If you insist, I'll prepare for a journey. Maybe roughing it for a few weeks will give me a taste for what Lord Godfrey experienced when he first ventured out."
