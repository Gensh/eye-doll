## Outline

- Castle is fucked up because it's where Godwyn got stabbed. His corrupted blood sunk deep into the pre-Order chapel below.
- Mention of how the Dragon Cult came to be identified with the Golden Lineage.
- Blames Margit for intruders getting in and thinks poorly of him. A mangy guard dog who comes back to be kicked.
- Not impressed by Carian doll at first glance. Starts freaking out as it leaps around him.
- Doll starts ripping off his grafted limbs and drinking the blood.
- Cuts off own arm but isn't allowed to phase change. Fight continues until Deathblight gets into the wound.
- Phase change: becomes infested with Deathbllight and swells to become clam-knight. Nightmare from SC.
- Begins to conflate his own memories with Godwyn's. Becomes confused and scared. Both just want to go home.
- Phase change: Integrates the dragon head at last, thinking it's Fortissax. Somehow uses Death Lightning anyway.
