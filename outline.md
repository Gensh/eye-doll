## Character touchstones

These are the characters who are persistent or whose influence on the story can't be avoided.

#### Marika

- Any amount of individual suffering and systematic oppression is worth the removal of death.
    - Had some unbearable pain in her past.
    - Thinks of herself as a martyr. Hasn't had a really great time despite being "queen".
- New Empyreans being appointed proved that the Order wasn't perfect.
    - What was even the point, then?
    - Refuses to let her whole life loop for someone else. Comparatively fond of Ranni.
    - Couldn't act directly against the Greater Will since its avatar is inside her body
- Still kind of empty. Fighting purely for her martyr complex.

#### Ranni

- Resents her father making her mother wither. Not just when he left but in making her so weak that she does.
- Proud of her heritage as astrologer-queens who read fate instead of having it demanded of them.
- Respected Godwyn as a person but resented him as the perfect puppet.
- Fully accepted Marika as her new mother and respects her for her will in spite of what it cost her own family.
    - Plans to follow Marika's example as a martyr, this time to deflect the gods' messages instead of channeling them.
- Still attached to Blaidd and Iji but knows she'll probably have to kill them and is resolved to do so.
- Has been scheming basically her entire life and doesn't know how to stop. Immense resentment under the surface as a result.

#### Rennala

- Originally felt freedom in her magic. Came to be overburdened by queenhood.
- Radgon taught her new freedom in submission to fate. When he left and took the kids "because God", it broke her.
- Returns to lucidity through deep-buried loathing of Marika. Their war was in some ways the reason she came to hate queenhood.
- Accepts Marika's deal to give herself a feeling of control while she figures out her own feelings.

#### Radagon

- Southern Baptist.
- Perfect gentleman on the surface. Quietly looks down on everyone.
- Everything has a place in the Order, and they should be grateful to submit.
    - Women are meant to be vessels for power which men then actually use.
    - Broke down Rennala by negging her over decades.

#### Morgott

- Desperately wants to be a "real person" and fulfill his "duty" in spite of his "curse".
- Because he's a loyalist, the other Omens hate him, including his twin. His father pitied him but was afraid to help more.
- The perfect victim for the propaganda that followed Radagon into the Capital.
    - Pleged his service to Radagon specifically, who he saw as increasingly infallible. Marika is inconsistent.
- Torn by Marika's return. Unsure if she's truly worthy but also afraid of disappointing her and wants some resolution.

## Outline

### The Stars Align

- Blaidd
    - Tone: Attentive. Guard dog.
    - Scene: About a week before the Shattering, in Leyndell.
    - What is a Shadowbound Beast?
    - Who was Blaidd before, and what is his relation to Ranni?
    - Ranni's relationship with her three parents.
- Shadow of the Princess
    - A mixture of Seluvis' dolls approaches the Rise, covered in his blood to mask its scent.
    - How did it get past the false Loretta? Adulla is scouting Manus Celes.
    - Forced to fight while protecting the Rise. Doll tries to climb the walls or get to the door.
    - Doll uses all doll weapons and can use viscerals at will.
    - Phase change: Blaidd becomes a shadow-beast. Ranni descends to ride his shoulder and keep him sane.
    - Ranni provides support spells or projectile hell. Blaidd has more blade spells. Like Lothric Twins but not ass. Blaidd similarly keeps getting up, but it's more a Berserk reference than immortality.
    - Eventually, Ranni realizes something. Hard cut. (She stops the fight because she recognizes stepmom.)
- Rennala
    - Tone: Ranting. Wordy scholar having the worst day of her life.
    - Scene: Having a meltdown right after Radagon left. Confessing her "sins" to Miriel in the hopes of some reversal.
    - Ranting about dealing with the dignity of her house. Turns to description of the war against the Erdtree.
    - Radagon seems perfectly genteel as an enemy, and she's flattered by the marriage. It's like he was made to save her.
    - Miriel susses out that he's been negging her. Turtlepope tries to convince her that she might be alright without without breaking her illusion about Radagon. She's in too deep.
    - Blames Marika for stealing her youth, her husband, and her kids but is too broken to actually do anything about it.
- Queen of the Benighted Aldtree
    - Phase 1 ends early. As soon as her soothing bubble breaks, she realizes something about the attacking doll. (It's Marika, that bitch.)
    - Phase change: Like Fume Knight, immediately goes full power Phase 2. Rather than a flighty caster like Ranni's illusion, she's a proud sorcerer-queen. No dumb hat. No mercy. Full Vegeta shit.
    - We finally learn what the moon is â€“ the fruit of a fallen Greatwood, with all the creative potential of its seeds harnessed by the Carian line.
    - Full-power Rennala is lesser than but of the same power level as Marika's real body, so Doll Marika has to leverage her wider combat experience and lack of morals.
    - Rennala isn't great at melee combat but can flood the area with projectiles and summons. She's not _afraid_ of melee combat, though, and she doesn't cast spells that leave her vulnerable. Instant Comet Azur sorts of tactics.
- Godrick
    - Tone: Curious. On edge. A child who knows something bad is happening.
    - Scene: A child on the last day before the Shattering.
    - Looks up to his uncle Godefroy as the pinnacle of knighthood. (And with one line, a copypaste boss becomes a tragedy.)
    - How do the people grieve for Godwyn and Ranni? How do they react to the Night of Black Knives?
    - What public appearances have Marika and Radagon made? Where are the other demigods?
    - How fucked is the moment of the Shattering?
    - Eventually has to sneak out of the capital disguised as a girl to avoid being drafted.
- Effigy of the Golden Lineage
    - Castle is fucked up because it's where Godwyn got stabbed. His corrupted blood sunk deep into the pre-Order chapel below.
    - Mention of how the Dragon Cult came to be identified with the Golden Lineage.
    - Blames Margit for intruders getting in and thinks poorly of him. A mangy guard dog who comes back to be kicked.
    - Not impressed by Carian doll at first glance. Starts freaking out as it leaps around him.
    - Doll starts ripping off his grafted limbs and drinking the blood.
    - Cuts off own arm but isn't allowed to phase change. Fight continues until Deathblight gets into the wound.
    - Phase change: becomes infested with Deathbllight and swells to become clam-knight. Nightmare from SC.
    - Begins to conflate his own memories with Godwyn's. Becomes confused and scared. Both just want to go home.
    - Phase change: Integrates the dragon head at last, thinking it's Fortissax. Somehow uses Death Lightning anyway.
- Radahn
    - Tone: Excited! Having a good time. Radahn is just a guy.
    - Scene: Caelid is a lush wilderness before the Shattering. Going fishing with some of his guys and Malenia's representative O'Neil.
    - Has a keen mind but is too much of a himbo to focus on the negative. Notices when lore happens but doesn't do anything. Hopes his land is too irrelevant to be swept into whatever shitshow is about to happen.
    - Knows his siblings are conspiring and is ready to do whatever to help but doesn't want to do politics. Hates what it's done to them and his parents.
- Conqueror of Fate
    - Radahn Festival is short Jerren since he's a bigot, and half the protagonists are witches. They dump his body offscreen.
    - Blaidd has initial perspective since he's normally present anyway. Alexander gets some focus since he's relevant later. Patches is actually present and doing something suspicious.
    - First phase is normal. 2v1 Blaidd and Alexander.
    - Patches shoots him with a speargun and nopes out. The golden spear looks like the Tree Sentinel halberd and sinks deeper and deeper into his flesh. He begins to go berserk, then does his falling star attack as normal.
        - Phase change: Gravity-driven red sand armor. Flame from his Great Rune. Looks like a Fire Giant with a tiny fiery horse. Attacks summon stars like Astel's.
    - Blaidd is about to have a bad time, but Radahn is repelled by a Waterfowl Dance. Millicent somehow already has a prosthesis, though it's a Carian doll arm instead of Malenia's hand-me-down. Radahn is enraged by the seeming reappearance of his archenemy.
    - The Doll appears at last, saving Milllicent in turn. They deal "damage" by driving the spear further into Radahn. Eventually, he hacks up Rotten blood and falls.
- Maliketh
    - Tone: In awe. Solemn. Slavish. Faithful to the point of self-harm. A loyal hound beyond death.
    - Scene: The Greater Will has decreed the numen have matured enough to inherit Order, and beasts no longer need be uplifted. It is the end for Maliketh's people, and he must guard one of the chosen numen maidens.
    - Keeps trying hard not to think about consequences. The Greater Will giveth, and the Greater Will taketh away.
    - Impressed by Marika's spirit, in respect of an apex predator thinking an angry kitten is funny.
    - Doesn't really listen to her. It's his job to guard and guide her; not to indulge her. This is opposite his later behavior.
- Shadow of the Queen
    - Gurranq is initially confused at who is approaching due to muddied and mixed scents.
    - Has a panic attack as the Rune of Death is abruptly ripped from him. Then realization sets in, and he becomes livid. How dare Marika?
    - Phase change: Gets bigger and stretches upright. More noble-looking like Serosh but still in his black armor. This is the high priest of the beastmen, unburdened by Death.
    - Full power Gurranq is a threat of the same kind as Radagon. Fast and hits like a truck while generating enough particle effects to blind you. Seamless mix of beast claw, ancient dragon, Crucible, and Two Finger incants.
    - Marika fights with her full strength this time, using the power of her collected Great Runes, multiple doll bodies, Black Knives, and Crucible, Erdtree, Fundamentalist, Blackflame, and Storm incants.
    - Marika has theoretically infinite lives, and Gurranq ultimately begs for death. He is incapable of betraying either master, and Marika's rebellion means he will suffer. Resolution left unclear.
