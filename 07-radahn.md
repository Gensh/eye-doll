## Outline

### Draft 1

- Tone: Excited! Having a good time. Radahn is just a guy.
- Scene: Caelid is a lush wilderness before the Shattering. Going fishing with some of his guys and Malenia's representative O'Neil.
- Has a keen mind but is too much of a himbo to focus on the negative. Notices when lore happens but doesn't do anything. Hopes his land is too irrelevant to be swept into whatever shitshow is about to happen.
- Knows his siblings are conspiring and is ready to do whatever to help but doesn't want to do politics. Hates what it's done to them and his parents.

### Migrated Rennala content

- Ranting about dealing with the dignity of her house. Turns to description of the war against the Erdtree.
- Radagon seems perfectly genteel as an enemy, and she's flattered by the marriage. It's like he was made to save her.
- Miriel susses out that he's been negging her. Turtlepope tries to convince her that she might be alright without without breaking her illusion about Radagon. She's in too deep.
- Blames Marika for stealing her youth, her husband, and her kids but is too broken to actually do anything about it.
- Emphasize the burdens of rule and also being the "maiden" of something. Show how they helped drag Rennala down, with the implication Marika is shackled all the more.
- Detail the fate of Caria and what Radahn did.
