## Outline

- Tone: Excited! Having a good time. Radahn is just a guy.
- Scene: Caelid is a lush wilderness before the Shattering. Going fishing with some of his guys and Malenia's representative O'Neil.
- Has a keen mind but is too much of a himbo to focus on the negative. Notices when lore happens but doesn't do anything. Hopes his land is too irrelevant to be swept into whatever shitshow is about to happen.
- Knows his siblings are conspiring and is ready to do whatever to help but doesn't want to do politics. Hates what it's done to them and his parents.
