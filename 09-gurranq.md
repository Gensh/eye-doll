## Outline

- Tone: In awe. Solemn. Slavish. Faithful to the point of self-harm. A loyal hound beyond death.
- Scene: The Greater Will has decreed the numen have matured enough to inherit Order, and beasts no longer need be uplifted. It is the end for Maliketh's people, and he must guard one of the chosen numen maidens.
- Keeps trying hard not to think about consequences. The Greater Will giveth, and the Greater Will taketh away.
- Impressed by Marika's spirit, in respect of an apex predator thinking an angry kitten is funny.
- Doesn't really listen to her. It's his job to guard and guide her; not to indulge her. This is opposite his later behavior.
- Young Marika has the same role as Shanalotte as an artificial maiden.
