## Outline

- Marika immediately understands the gimmick. Show her death point gimmick. Elegant and efficient.
- Eye contact when the barrier breaks. Note similarity in skin color/taint.
- Realizes something about the attacking doll. (It's Marika, that bitch.)
- Marika tries to take the Amber Egg and triggers a panic attack.
- Phase change: Like Fume Knight, immediately goes full power Phase 2. Rather than a flighty caster like Ranni's illusion, she's a proud sorcerer-queen. Full Vegeta shit.
- Yeets Marika across the room and screams. Bookshelves shake. Cradles fall.
- We finally learn what the moon is â€“ the fruit of a fallen Greatwood, with all the creative potential of its seeds harnessed by the Carian line.
- Full-power Rennala is lesser than but in the same power level as Marika's real body, so Doll Marika has to leverage her wider combat experience and lack of morals.
- More than Ranni's full moon illusion, full-power Rennala does Byrgenwerth Ritual reveal moon. Unlike Ranni's cold, dark, and gentle Darkmoon, the Full Moon is intolerably pure silver. She hides the Amber Egg within.
- Rennala isn't great at melee combat but can flood the area with projectiles and summons. She's not _afraid_ of melee combat, though, and she doesn't cast spells that leave her vulnerable. Instant Comet Azur sorts of tactics. She's also _much bigger_ than the puppet.
- Just outright use every blue spell in the franchise.
- When Marika tries to grab her scepter, she makes it spin.
- Marika knocks off the silly hat at some point to unfurl big Filianore hair. Rennala catches her crown and uses it as the Crystal Ring Shield.
- Run the fight until the narrative starts to drag. Then Ranni walks in and acts like she let two kids roughhouse to get it out of their systems.
