The massive doors of the Grand Library swung open at once. Only a faint light streamed in from outside as the Dolores puppet entered. Her missing fingers and outfit were replaced, though the sleeves and boots were missing for some reason. There was neither bow nor arrows nor any weapon at all. A moment after her entry, the doors gently closed on their own, seeming to bend and shift like living flesh. The doll's porcelain feet trod over the ancient rug which led to the center of the chamber.

In spite of the darkness, she looked about with intent. Gazing between towering bookshelves and pillars which could hold up the sky, a body almost went unnoticed. One of the Academy's students tried to grab at her foot. "Dolores" swung her foot backward with a sharp bounce. A young woman looked up at her vacantly, as empty as the puppet was possessed. The sorcerer's eyes were dull gold like the Tarnished. Yet the Library had been sealed too long for that. This was neither an individual who had been trapped, nor one of the last to return. This woman had been reborn as something incompatible with her nature.



## Outline

- Marika immediately understands the gimmick. Show her death point gimmick. Elegant and efficient.
- Eye contact when the barrier breaks. Note similarity in skin color/taint.
- Realizes something about the attacking doll. (It's Marika, that bitch.)
- Marika tries to take the Amber Egg and triggers a panic attack.
- Phase change: Like Fume Knight, immediately goes full power Phase 2. Rather than a flighty caster like Ranni's illusion, she's a proud sorcerer-queen. Full Vegeta shit.
- Yeets Marika across the room and screams. Bookshelves shake. Cradles fall.
- We finally learn what the moon is â€“ the fruit of a fallen Greatwood, with all the creative potential of its seeds harnessed by the Carian line.
- Full-power Rennala is lesser than but in the same power level as Marika's real body, so Doll Marika has to leverage her wider combat experience and lack of morals.
- More than Ranni's full moon illusion, full-power Rennala does Byrgenwerth Ritual reveal moon. Unlike Ranni's cold, dark, and gentle Darkmoon, the Full Moon is intolerably pure silver. She hides the Amber Egg within.
- Rennala isn't great at melee combat but can flood the area with projectiles and summons. She's not _afraid_ of melee combat, though, and she doesn't cast spells that leave her vulnerable. Instant Comet Azur sorts of tactics. She's also _much bigger_ than the puppet.
- Just outright use every blue spell in the franchise.
- When Marika tries to grab her scepter, she makes it spin.
- Marika knocks off the silly hat at some point to unfurl big Filianore hair. Rennala catches her crown and uses it as the Crystal Ring Shield.
- Run the fight until the narrative starts to drag. Then Ranni walks in and acts like she let two kids roughhouse to get it out of their systems.
