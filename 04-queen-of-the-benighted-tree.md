## Outline

- Phase 1 ends early. As soon as her soothing bubble breaks, she realizes something about the attacking doll. (It's Marika, that bitch.)
- Phase change: Like Fume Knight, immediately goes full power Phase 2. Rather than a flighty caster like Ranni's illusion, she's a proud sorcerer-queen. No dumb hat. No mercy. Full Vegeta shit.
- We finally learn what the moon is â€“ the fruit of a fallen Greatwood, with all the creative potential of its seeds harnessed by the Carian line.
- Full-power Rennala is lesser than but of the same power level as Marika's real body, so Doll Marika has to leverage her wider combat experience and lack of morals.
- Rennala isn't great at melee combat but can flood the area with projectiles and summons. She's not _afraid_ of melee combat, though, and she doesn't cast spells that leave her vulnerable. Instant Comet Azur sorts of tactics.
